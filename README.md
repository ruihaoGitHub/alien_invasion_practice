This is an extended version of the "Alien Invasion" game from the book *Python Crash Course*.

## ✨ New Features (My Contributions)
1. **High Score Persistence**: The highest score is saved to `high_score.json` and loaded automatically when the game starts.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FruihaoGitHub%2Falien_invasion_practice)]
2. **Sound Effects**: Added shooting sounds and explosion sounds when aliens are hit.
