# Alien Invasion - Expanded Version
This is an extended version of the "Alien Invasion" game from the book *Python Crash Course*.

## ✨ New Features (My Contributions)
1. **High Score Persistence**: The highest score is saved to `high_score.json` and loaded automatically when the game starts.
2. **Sound Effects**: Added shooting sounds and explosion sounds when aliens are hit.
